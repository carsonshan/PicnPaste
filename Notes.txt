            <input type="file" accept="video/*;capture=camcorder">
            <input type="file" accept="audio/*;capture=microphone">
            or (new method)

            <device type="media" onchange="update(this.data)"></device>
            <video autoplay></video>
            <script>
              function update(stream) {
                document.querySelector('video').src = stream.url;
              }
            </script>
            If it is not, probably will work on ios6, more detail can be found at get user media


From GOOGLE DOCS:
“PICTURE PASTE” Mobile App
    Very Simple - It’s a chrome extension or maybe a desktop application (look up how those copy paste managers are created) that lets you take a picture with your phone and have it immediately paste into the document you are working in

    Can work like this:
        ON COMPUTER:
            + Right-click where you want to paste a picture
            + A loady-gif appears that waits for a picture
        ON PHONE:
            + Open up the app, take the picture and click ‘OK’ if you like it
            + The app recognizes that it has a place to send the image
            + Otherwise ERROR
        ON COMPUTER:
            + The desktop sees that an image is sent and copy-pastes it into place
            + Maybe there is a confirmation here, but I don’t think there should be. It would just slow down the process.
        Should work BOTH ways
            + I.e, I should be able to take a picture on my phone first and have it wait for a response from the computer, or right click on the computer and have it wait for a response from the app.
        Would be really great for note taking
        Tali can test this out


GCM
+ Only allows messages with size of 4000 bytes (.004mb)
+ Would only allow sending of very tiny images - so Not Applicable
+ HOWEVER, You can use GSM to push to the Chrome Extension a notification to let it know that there is new data to pull from the server

Long-Polling
+ Long polling seems like what you might want here.
+ Pic n' Paste Extension opens up a connection with the server
    + Everytime the server gets a new image, it is sent directly to the extension where it can be copy pasted.

Permissions I will need:
    + https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/declare_permissions
    + 'clipboardRead'
        + For Paste
    + 'clipboardWrite'
        + For COPY
    + 'activeTab'
        + Use the activeTab permission in order to be able to interact with a page after the user clicks on your page action.
    + 'contextMenus'
        + For access to Right Click menu bar
    + 'gcm'
        + For access to chrome.gcm if I decide not to use Firebase
    +


How it should work:
    Two Paths:
        + Phone First:
            + Phone: User opens app, chooses to take a picture, and does so.
                + Database recieved image and uses GCM to notify the extension that an image is waiting
                    + A little '1' appears on the icon maybe
            + PC: User clicks the little icon and sees his/her image for copy pasting, OR they can simply right click and select to paste and the most recent image (or all the most recent images?) will be pasted.
        + Computer First:
            + PC: Click chrome extension Icon OR Right click where you want to paste
                + Loady Bar waits for an image to come in.
            + Phone: Open up app, Take picture, Send to database
                + Database recieves image, sends push notification to PICn'Paste Extension
            + PC: Extension receives the notification, reaches out to server for the new image, and uploads to the screen
                + If the user has click the extension icon, he can either click the image/button to copy the image to his/her clipboard, or they can right click, hover over the pic'n'paste option and paste it whereever they want
                + If the user right clicked to start, then the image is just immediately pasted into the document
    ALso:
        The extension icon AND the right click menu should have options to paste most recent image AND a menu item to see all saved images to choose from.

How Phone App should work:
    Four screens
        + Log In
        + Sign Up
        + Take Pictures
        + Past Pictures
    1. You can either take a new picture and send it to firebase immediately
    2. You can send a picture you have taken previously

    Thats it!

How Extension should work:
    List of most recent picture first (and maybe most recent 5 with the most recent one first)
    Clicking a picture copies it
    Right click at a point in the document and select 'paste' or something, and a loady bar will appear and wait for the most recent picture from your phone.


Order of Tasks:
    1. Chrome Extension:
        + Using a Test Image, get it to copy the image to my clipboard by clicking on it
        + Get PicnPaste in the context menu
            + Get a paste option in there that pastes the most recent image
            + Get a 'last 5 images' option that shows you last 5 images to paste. Selecting one immediately pastes it

    2. Website:
        + Get it to perform like a mobile app
        + Get Camera working
        + Get it to save images to firebase
        + Get it to load images from firebase

    3. Communcation
        + Get web app to send a GCM notification to chrome extension
        + Chrome extension should notify user that a new image is available
        + Clicking the icon in browser should load all new images from firebase
        + Right clicking


README.md notes:
    debugging:
        + Right Click on Extension Icon
        + Select Inspect Popup
        + Background Stripts
            Your script in your manifest.json runs in the background page:
                "background": {
                    "scripts": [
                        "popup.js"
                    ]
                },

            + so any messages or console.logs will be displayed in the background page's console.

                1. Open the Extensions page.
                2. Make sure that Developer mode is checked.
                3. Under My Extension, click _generated_background_page.html to inspect it.
                4. Click on the Console tab.
